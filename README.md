# Analysis-of-GPSR-routing-protocol-for-vehicular-Ad-Hoc-networks
This project is developed for my Computer Networks project in the Third year (5th semester).
Vehicular ad-hoc networks have grown drastically to perform many applications relating to automobiles and passenger safety with the development of fast-paced
modern technological world. Because of such a rapid change, there are many challenges which occurred lately. These include high speed of cars, congested traffic, 
unexpected topology and locations, which must be solved at the same time. Numerous routing protocols have been developed to encounter these issues. 
Out of these the greedy forwarding algorithm and right-hand forwarding are used by the distance-based greedy perimeter stateless routing protocol (GPSR)
and next-hop selection to forward the data to the following node. This protocol sends the data to nodes in a way, that places them close to the destination
and in its neighboring region. Several parameters including throughput, data rate, have been represented in graphs for this network scenario using MATLAB software.
